# Attribute-Based_Car_Price_Prediction_System
Built a full machine-learning pipeline to predict used-car prices based on structured vehicle attributes (brand, model year, mileage, fuel type, transmission, engine size, etc.). The project included dataset acquisition, data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and deployment as a Streamlit web application.
